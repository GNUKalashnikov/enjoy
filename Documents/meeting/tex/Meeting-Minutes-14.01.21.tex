\subsection{Absences}

Stevens - Not at fault (Was not added to this discussion due to the nature of the discussion) 

\subsection{Agenda}

Discussion was oriented around grasping and establishing a clearly defined structure to the back-end of our project, defining clearly the folders, databases, names and content and methods. Tasks were also discussed in some detail. User permissions were of the topic and so was implementing a level of censorship.

\subsection{Meeting Summary}

The meeting was very successful in establishing a detailed although not finished structure to the back-end of our project, with the UML diagram and this combined we have some understanding into what the application will function internally.
