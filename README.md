Enjoy in a application on android and IOS(soon) as well as a React web app, created as a final year project

Enjoy takes your love of music and movies to make meaningful connections with people with like mineded intrests.
Using our algorithm we try to make a unique platform, where music lovers and movie watchers can meet and discuss
their personal intrests, establishing meaningful disscussion from the oneset between users.

Currently, a focal point to be fixed and improved, will be finished or at least altered to a near complete state 13.03.2021

Use-case diagram has been completed but will be iterated on as changes since conceptualisation has ushered in changes to our project

# Roadmap

## WebDev

Functionality that already exists in the codebase has to be refined and made local
* User creation & Logging
* Registration 
* Scripting

Determine the middle managers between the backend and frontend.
This is a tug of war between a bespoke more minimal but more time-consuming php solution or a rather more simplefied express.js/Premade framework
